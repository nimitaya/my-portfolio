# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase a little about myself and my first projects as I learn web development.
This is still a **work in progress!**

## About

I'm currently a full-time student in a web development course, learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This site is a place to present my skills, experience, and some of the projects I've worked on so far.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – for building the user interface
- **Vite** – for fast development and build tooling
- **CSS** – for styling (with custom styles)
- **GitHub API** – to fetch and display my public projects

## Features

- Responsive design
- Information about my skills and tools
- Project showcase section
